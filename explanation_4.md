# Problem 4

## Reasoning Behind Decisions

The `Group` class and `is_user_in_group` function are designed to efficiently represent and search for users within a hierarchical group structure. Key design choices include:

1. **Hierarchical Group Representation**: The `Group` class maintains a list of users and a list of sub-groups, allowing a nested structure.
2. **Recursive-Like Search Using Iterative DFS**: The `is_user_in_group` function employs an iterative depth-first search (DFS) using a stack. This avoids potential recursion depth limits in Python while efficiently exploring all sub-groups.
3. **Efficient Membership Check**: Instead of iterating over all users manually, `if user in current_group.get_users()` provides an efficient way to determine membership in a given group.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: The function properly handles cases where the user is `None`, an empty string, or belongs to deeply nested structures.
5. **Scalability**: The function is designed to work efficiently even when handling a large number of groups and users, ensuring robustness for extensive hierarchy searches.

## Time Efficiency

The time complexity of `is_user_in_group(user, group)` is:

1. **Checking Users in a Group**: `if user in current_group.get_users()` runs in **O(U)**, where `U` is the number of users in the current group.
2. **Iterative DFS Traversal**:
   - Each group is visited once.
   - Adding and removing elements from a stack is **O(1)** per operation.
   - Since each group is processed once, the total time complexity is **O(G + U)**, where `G` is the number of groups and `U` is the total number of users across all groups.
3. **Worst-Case Scenario**:
   - In a highly nested structure, all `G` groups must be visited.
   - If every group has a large number of users, the search may take **O(G + U)** time in the worst case.

Thus, the approach is efficient for both shallow and deep hierarchical structures, balancing search depth and breadth effectively.

## Space Efficiency

The space complexity of `is_user_in_group(user, group)` is:

1. **Stack Space for DFS Traversal**:
   - In the worst case (deeply nested groups), the stack may hold up to **O(G)** groups.
   - However, this is significantly better than a recursive approach, which would use **O(G)** function call frames.
2. **Storage for Group Structure**:
   - Each `Group` instance stores a list of sub-groups and a list of users.
   - If `N` is the total number of users and `G` is the number of groups, the space usage is **O(G + N)**.
3. **No Extra Memory Usage**:
   - The function does not create auxiliary data structures beyond the stack, making it memory-efficient.

Overall, the implementation maintains an optimal balance between memory efficiency and search speed, ensuring scalability for large and deeply nested group hierarchies.
